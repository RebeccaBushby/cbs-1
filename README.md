## Troubleshooting

Nokogiri (é‹¸) is a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with XPath and CSS selector support.
Command `bundle install` tries to install `nokogiri`

If you face following error:
	`Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.`

You can fix it as follows:

For Ubuntu/Debian OS:
Run the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev` and try again.

If you are using any other OS, you can follow the instructions mentioned here:
