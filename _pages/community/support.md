CBS is a free and open source software project that is availble to all red cross and red cresent socities as software as a service. Our work is supported by a growing community of developers, implementers, and users -- as well as various organizations. Core CBS development is supported by ongoing research at the International Department of [Norwegian Red Cross](http://rodekors.no) as well as through financial contributions from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Innovation Norway.

We encourage everyone to [get involved directly](/community/) in the work of the CBS Community. If you would like to support CBS's continued research and development financially, you can also [donate through the Norwegian Red Cross](https://rodekors.no).
