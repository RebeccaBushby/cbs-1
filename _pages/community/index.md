Community based Surveillance is an open and welcoming community of people just like you! Our mission is to help millions around the world collect, analyse, and take evidence based decision in near real-time.

We value open communities and open source and our work is user-focused and deployment-centric. See our [Mission and Values](https://github.com/ifrcgo/cbs/governance/blob/master/MISSION-AND-VALUES.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ifrcgo/cbs/governance/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) for more.

We follow a meritocratic governance model where a Project Steering Committee oversees the project while Technical Steering Committees oversee the technical direction of CBS software. See [Governance](/community/governance) for more.

No matter your background, talent, or skill, you can help make CBS better. Here are some ways you can get involved!
